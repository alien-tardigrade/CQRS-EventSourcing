Event Store
1. Append-only store, no updates and deletes allowed
2. Each event is a fact, a statement of something that happened and represents a version of the state at any point in time
3. Events are immutable and cannot be changed
4. Events are stored in the order they were created
5. State of the aggregate is built by replaying the events
6. Implement Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) to ensure that the state is not changed by multiple threads at the same time
